I used to be not outspoken. Now, I am very confident and active participating in school activities. It's all thanks to your
encouragement ever since you became my form teacher. Your unique teaching style made me feel very comfortable at class and
helped me to absorb the teaching materials. Thanks for giving me so many chances to learn, such as letting me become a monitor.
It helped me to be more sociable and learn how to deal with people.
Thank you, Ms. Linda.
Keep in touch
