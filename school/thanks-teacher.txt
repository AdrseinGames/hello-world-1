Back at the beginning of the year, I was not outspoken. Today I have strong confidence communicating and actively participating
in school activities. It's all thanks to your encouragement ever since you have become my form teacher. Your unique teaching
style made me feel very comfortable at class and help me to absorb the teaching materials. Thanks for giving me so many chances
to learn and assigning me as class monitor. This assignment helped me to be more sociable and to deal with people.
Thank you, Ms. Linda.
Keep in touch
